  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

  <p>
    Your privacy is critically important to us, so at FOHAMU we have a few
    fundamental principles. If you find content on the FOHAMU website you believe
    violates our Privacy Policy, please contact us immediately.
  </p>

  <p>
    We don’t ask you for personal information unless we truly need it.
    We can’t stand services that ask you for things like your gender or
    income level for no apparent reason.
  </p>

  <p>
    We don’t share your personal information with anyone except to comply with
    the law, develop our products, or protect our rights.
  </p>

  <p>
    We don’t store personal information on our servers unless required for the
    ongoing operation of one of our services.
  </p>

  <h3>FOHAMU Inc.</h3>
  <p>
    “FOHAMU” operates a website at fohamu.org. It is FOHAMU’s policy to respect
    your privacy regarding any information we may collect while operating our website.
    If you have questions about deleting or correcting your personal data please
    contact our support team.
  </p>

  <h3>Website Visitors</h3>
  <p>
    Like most website operators, FOHAMU collects non-personally-identifying
    information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make
    available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site,
    and the date and time of each visitor request. FOHAMU’s purpose in collecting
    non-personally identifying information is to better understand
    how FOHAMU’s visitors use its website. From time to time, FOHAMU may release
    non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing
    a report on trends in the usage of its website.
  </p>

  <p>
    FOHAMU also collects potentially personally-identifying information like
    Internet Protocol (IP) addresses for logged in users and for users leaving
    comments on articles published. FOHAMU only discloses logged in user and
    commenter IP addresses under the same circumstances that it uses and
    discloses personally-identifying information as described below, except that
    blog commenter IP addresses are visible and disclosed to the administrators
    of the blog where the comment was left.
  </p>

  <h3>Personally-Identifying Information</h3>
  <p>
    Certain visitors to FOHAMU’s websites choose to interact with FOHAMU in ways
    that require FOHAMU to gather personally-identifying information. The amount
    and type of information that FOHAMU gathers depends on the nature of the
    interaction. For example, we ask visitors who sign up for membership at
    fohamu.org to provide a username and email address.
  </p>

  <p>
    Those who engage in transactions with FOHAMU — by purchasing services,
    for example — are asked to provide additional information, including as
    necessary the personal and financial information required to process those
    transactions. In each case, FOHAMU collects such information only insofar
    as is necessary or appropriate to fulfill the purpose of the visitor’s
    interaction with FOHAMU. FOHAMU does not disclose personally-identifying
    information other than as described below. And visitors can always refuse to
    supply personally-identifying information, with the caveat that it may
    prevent them from engaging in certain website-related activities.
  </p>

  <h3>Aggregated Statistics</h3>
  <p>
    FOHAMU may collect statistics about the behavior of visitors to its website.
    For instance, FOHAMU may monitor the most popular pages and articles on the
    fohamu.org site or use spam screened by the Akismet service to help identify
    spammers. FOHAMU may display this information publicly or provide it to others.
    However, FOHAMU does not disclose personally-identifying information other
    than as described below.
  </p>

  <h3>Business Transfers</h3>
  <p>
    If FOHAMU, or substantially all of its assets, were acquired, or in the
    unlikely event that FOHAMU goes out of business or enters bankruptcy, user
    information would be one of the assets that is transferred or acquired by a
    third party. You acknowledge that such transfers may occur, and that any
    acquirer of FOHAMU may continue to use your personal information as set
    forth in this policy.
  </p>

  <h3>Ads</h3>
  <p>
    Any Ads appearing on our website may be delivered to users by advertising
    partners, who may set cookies. These cookies allow the ad server to
    recognize your computer each time they send you an online advertisement
    to compile information about you or others who use your computer. This
    information allows ad networks to, among other things, deliver targeted
    advertisements that they believe will be of most interest to you. This
    Privacy Policy covers the use of cookies by FOHAMU and does not cover the
    use of cookies by any such advertisers.
  </p>

  <h3>Privacy Policy Changes</h3>
  <p>
    Although most changes are likely to be minor, FOHAMU may change its
    Privacy Policy from time to time, and at FOHAMU’s sole discretion.
    FOHAMU encourages visitors to frequently check this page for any changes to
    its Privacy Policy. If you have a fohamu.org account, you should also check
    your blog’s dashboard for alerts to these changes. Your continued use of this
    site after any change in this Privacy Policy will constitute your
    acceptance of such change.
  </p>

  <h3>Protection of Information</h3>
  <p>
    FOHAMU discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying
    information only to those of its employees, contractors and affiliated
    organizations that:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      (i) need to know that information in order to process it on FOHAMU’s behalf or to provide services available at FOHAMU’s websites, and
    </li>
    <li>
      (ii) that have agreed not to disclose it to others.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Some of those employees, contractors and affiliated organizations may be
    located outside of your home country; by using FOHAMU’s websites, you consent
    to the transfer of such information to them. FOHAMU will not rent or sell
    potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information to anyone.
  </p>

  <p>
    Other than to its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations, as
    described above, FOHAMU discloses potentially personally-identifying and
    personally-identifying information only in response to a subpoena, court
    order or other governmental request, or when FOHAMU believes in good faith
    that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of
    FOHAMU, third parties or the public at large.
  </p>

  <p>
    If you are a registered user of an FOHAMU website and have supplied your
    email address, FOHAMU may occasionally send you an email to tell you about
    new features, solicit your feedback, or just keep you up to date with what’s
    going on with FOHAMU and our services. We primarily use our website to
    communicate this type of information, so we expect to keep this type of
    email to a minimum.
  </p>

  <p>
    If you send us a request (for example via a support email or via one of our
    feedback mechanisms), we reserve the right to publish it in order to help us
    clarify or respond to your request or to help us support other users.
    FOHAMU takes all measures reasonably necessary to protect against the
    unauthorized access, use, alteration or destruction of potentially
    personally-identifying and personally-identifying information.
  </p>

  <h3>Email Communication</h3>
  <p>
    FOHAMU sends a newsletter and occasional nonprofit marketing updates that we
    believe will be useful to individuals that subscribe to our website or blog,
    download a whitepaper, or request updates. Users may remove themselves from
    this mailing list by following the link provided in every email. We will not
    sell, distribute or lease your personal information to third parties unless
    we have your permission or are required by law.
  </p>

  <h3>Cookies</h3>
  <p>
    A cookie is a string of information that a website stores on a visitor’s
    computer, and that the visitor’s browser provides to the website each time
    the visitor returns. FOHAMU uses cookies to help FOHAMU identify and track
    visitors, their usage of FOHAMU website, and their website access
    preferences.
  </p>

  <p>
    FOHAMU visitors who do not wish to have cookies placed on their computers
    should set their browsers to refuse cookies before using fohamu’s websites,
    with the drawback that certain features of FOHAMU’s websites may not function
    properly without the aid of cookies.

      <strong>Responsibility of Website Visitors.</strong>&nbsp;
      Focus Haitian Music has not reviewed, and cannot review, all of the material,
      including computer software, posted to the Website, and cannot therefore
      be responsible for that material’s content, use or effects. By operating
      the Website, Focus Haitian Music does not represent or imply that it
      endorses the material there posted, or that it believes such material to
      be accurate, useful or non-harmful. You are responsible for taking precautions
      as necessary to protect yourself and your computer systems from viruses, worms,
      Trojan horses, and other harmful or destructive content. The Website may contain
      content that is offensive, indecent, or otherwise objectionable, as well as
      content containing technical inaccuracies, typographical mistakes, and other errors.
      The Website may also contain material that violates the privacy or publicity rights,
      or infringes the intellectual property and other proprietary rights, of third
      parties, or the downloading, copying or use of which is subject to additional
      terms and conditions, stated or unstated. Focus Haitian Music disclaims any
      responsibility for any harm resulting from the use by visitors of the Website,

      which FOHAMU.org links, and that link to FOHAMU.org. Focus Haitian Music
      does not have any control over these websites and webpages, and is not
      responsible for their contents or their use. By linking to a non-Focus
      Haitian Music website or webpage, Focus Haitian Music does not represent or
      imply that it endorses such website or webpage. You are responsible for
      taking precautions as necessary to protect yourself and your computer systems
      from viruses, worms, Trojan horses, and other harmful or destructive content.

      <strong>Copyright Infringement and DMCA Policy.</strong>&nbsp;
      As Focus Haitian Music asks others to respect its intellectual property rights,

      are encouraged to notify Focus Haitian Music in accordance with&nbsp;
      Focus Haitian Music’ Digital Millennium Copyright Act (“DMCA”) Policy.
      Focus Haitian Music will respond to all such notices, including as
      required or appropriate by removing the infringing material or disabling
      all links to the infringing material. Focus Haitian Music will terminate a
      visitor’s access to and use of the Website if, under appropriate circumstances,
      the visitor is determined to be a repeat infringer of the copyrights or
      other intellectual property rights of Focus Haitian Music or others.
      In the case of such termination, Focus Haitian Music will have no obligation
      to provide a refund of any amounts previously paid to Focus Haitian Music.

      solely with Focus Haitian Music. Focus Haitian Music, FOHAMU.org, and the
